# Types of contributions :memo:
You can contribute to Datiriums Workflows in several ways. 

- [Discussions](#discussions)
- [Issues](#issues)
- [Pull Requests](#pull-requests)

---

### Discussions
Discussions are where we have conversations related to workflows and their usage within SciDAP.

If you'd like help troubleshooting a PR you're working on, have a great new idea for a workflow, or want to share something amazing you've learned in our docs, join us in [discussions](https://github.com/datirium/workflows/discussions).

---

### Issues

[Issues](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/about-issues) are used to track tasks that contributors can help with. If an issue has a triage label, we haven't reviewed it yet, and you shouldn't begin work on it.

If you've found a bug in workflows or their analyses, search open issues to see if someone else has reported the same thing. If it's something new, open an issue using a [template](https://github.com/datirium/workflows/issues/new/choose). 

We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix, as well as for tracking development.

### Pull requests

A [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) is a way to suggest/provide changes to our repository. 

If those changes involve updating analyses themselves (tools/workflows), then updated versions for modified/affected analyses will be automatically deployed to the SciDAP platform when the PR is merged. :earth_africa:

We currently don't accept changes to docker files/images used by our tools. If you believe there's an issue with a docker image used by a tool in some workflow, open an issue outlining these concerns so our Bioinformaticians can investigate.

### :question: Support
We are a small team working hard to keep up with the documentation demands of a continuously changing product. Unfortunately, we just can't help with support questions in this repository. If you are experiencing a problem with the SciDAP platform, unrelated to workflows, please [contact Datirium Support directly](//TODO:(mailtolink_or_hubspot_link)mailto://support@datirium.com). Any issues, discussions, or pull requests opened here requesting support will be given information about how to contact Datirium Support, then closed and locked.
