# Semantic Versioning for Workflows

- [Summary](#summary)
- [Alternative versioning](#alternative-versioning)

## Summary

Every individual workflow and tool has it's own version control.

We currently follow a semVer versioning structure

> Ex: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH



## Alternative Versioning

An alternative versioning solution that partly simplifies our versioning needs is as follows

MAJOR.MAJOR.PATCH 

> Ex: 
> a worklow on version 1.2.3 that experiences a MAJOR update, will go to version 1.3.0
> a workflow on version 2.9.5 that experiences a MAJOR update will go to version 3.0.0
> a workflow on version 1.0.9 that experiences a PATCH update will go to version 1.0.10
